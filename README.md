# Pythonic Summer 2023

In this project, my goal is to enhance my knowledge and skills in Python programming over the summer break of 2023. From the beginning of June until the end of July, I will dedicate each day to exploring a new programming concept. Specifically, I will focus on improving my proficiency in the following areas:

1. Core Python
2. Documentation
2. Exception handling
3. Object-oriented paradigm
4. Test-driven development
5. Concurrent and parallel computing
